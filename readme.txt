Fairy Garden is a 2D top-view action game that I created for a 2D game development course using OpenGL and C++.

Install Instructions
- The easiest way to install the source code is to use CMake-gui and set the LIBRARY_PATH variable to the directory where you have the .lib files for GLEW, GLFW and SOIL
- You can also use CMake in the terminal, but you will have to set environment variables manually

Testing Instructions
- Either run it from an IDE like Visual Studio 2022 or run cmake --build <output-directory>

This project contains code from the COMP2501 demos:
